**ahy568/ahy568** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a couple of personal projects of mine and also working on finding another internship/Co-Op.
- ğŸŒ± Some of my hobbies include playing sports, video games, and building personal projects like for exmaple my Carbon Fiber Electric Longboard.
- ğŸ‘¯ I amd interested in learning more about C and how it can optimize Aerosapce Systems.
